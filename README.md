# children-books-personalized

# Project overview

Personalized Children Books will use AI to create children’s books based on prompts. After it is ready, the AI will create images and the application will format the text and images to deliver the book.

# Background and context

The idea is to create personalized histories that will relate to the kid’s experiences and empower them. This could help kids that are facing traumas or that are still not properly represented in society.
The target community involves all groups of people, schools, government bodies, psychologists, and similar entities.
