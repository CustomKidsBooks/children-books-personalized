This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Project overview
Personalized Children Books will use AI to create children’s books based on prompts. After it is ready, the AI will create images and the application will format the text and images to deliver the book.

# Background and context
The idea is to create personalized histories that will relate to the kid’s experiences and empower them. This could help kids that are facing traumas or that are still not properly represented in society.
The target community involves all groups of people, schools, government bodies, psychologists, and similar entities.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
